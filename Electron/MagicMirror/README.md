**MagicMirror²** is an open source modular smart mirror platform. 

MagicMirror² focuses on a modular plugin system and uses [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) as an application wrapper. So no more web server or browser installs necessary!

This repo features the base open-source application with a number of custom made modules to suit smart home, and voice activated chatGPT integration.
