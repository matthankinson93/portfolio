        "A supernova remnant, the structure resulting from the explosion of a star in a supernova, can last for tens of thousands of years.",
        "Neutron stars have a limit known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit; if they gain mass beyond this, they collapse into black holes.",
        "The heaviest elements in the universe, like gold and platinum, are believed to be produced by neutron star collisions.",
        "The Crab Nebula is a famous supernova remnant observed in 1054 AD, and at its center lies a pulsar, a type of rapidly rotating neutron star.",
