## To run development server

The easiest way to run a development php server is via XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/
Enable the apache and mySQL servers from the XAMPP control panel
Ensure your php project is located inside the /xamp/htdocs' directory to make it accessible from XAMPP.
Navigate to http://localhost/path-to-server where 'path-to-server' is the location of your php project.
