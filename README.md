# Mathew Hankinson portfolio.

 ### To demonstrate the basic concepts of full-stack web development, I have built a basic IOT / remote telemetry portal utilizing 3 different tech stacks:

- Angular_node - this is built using the Angular framework for the front end, expressJs for the back end, and integrates with a postgres SQL database.
- Django_brython - this is built using Brython for the front end and django for the backend.
- Blazor_cSharp - this is built using the ASP.NET framework.

### The purpose of this is to demonstrate important concepts applied across a different range of frameworks.

### The functionality of this application includes:

- Login authentication using JWT.
- Adding a new device, which generates a unique UUID, authentication token, and name.
- Adding new users via email.
- Viewing device telemetry (latest values, and timeseries data).
- Api endpoints for posting device telemetry to the application.


To see more framework version, please view the README of each directory.
